# Homepage for Nexusia Z

This is a temporary homepage until we decide what framework to use.

It uses TailwindCSS and Vite for the build.

We are deploying this using netlify, but using gh actions on PRs on main to make sure that the project builds properly.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```
