# Homepage for Nexusia Z

This is a temporary homepage until we decide what framework to use.

It uses TailwindCSS and Vite for the build.

This should get a github pages site up and running once we setup an action to build and deploy.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```
